# Elderio-s-Tale
Elderio's Tale is a little italian JRPG Inspired By Sweet Home (but no, it's not scary at all)
Elderio's Tale is a story of an old man who is loosing anytime at King of Fighters 1998.
He works at INPS an italian statal society who provide to collect taxes and give retirement from older or invalid.
This project is not as good as many others made in rpg maker, but it was developed on twitch stream with the chat: they were the brain, I was the hand.
